            Send the following letter to your
            representative in U.S. Congress
        </div>
        <div class="letter_text">
            <div class="greet">
                Dear [name of the representative],
            </div>
            </br>
            <div>Today I am urgently asking you to actively support immediate delivery of Eastern European fighter
                planes to Ukraine.
                The brave Ukrainian army and the country’s heroic citizens are winning the war on the ground.
                The problem is that Ukrainian cities are being destroyed and citizens are being murdered from the
                air.
                I am requesting your urgent help in convincing the White House that immediate delivery of MIG planes
                to
                Ukraine should be the highest priority in support of a free Ukraine.
                What we are witnessing is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. We have an ability in this
                country
                and allied bases in Europe to stop these murderous attacks from the air.
                We have a moral obligation to do so. Our words are meant to reinforce President Zelenskyy urgent
                demands
                for fighter planes.
                Ukrainian cities are laying in ruins and thousands of civilians are dead and will keep dying because
                Ukraine is denied fighter jets.
                <b>These planes are defensive, NOT offensive weapons: they will protect Ukrainian sky from Russian
                    air
                    raids.</b></div>
            </br>
            <div> There are MiG 29 warplanes sitting at allied bases in Europe, ready for an immediate transfer.
                Ukrainian pilots are well-trained on these warplanes and can use them to stop these murderous
                attacks
                from the air tonight!
            </div>
            </br>
            <div>
                We can no longer stand back and watch schools, hospitals, homes, apartment buildings, bomb shelters,
                every day people of all ages being mass murdered on a daily basis.
                The news that a mother in labor and her unborn baby died after a maternity ward was bombed in
                Mariupol
                broke my heart.
                It is a tragedy that could have been prevented if Ukraine had the planes to defend its sky.
                I give you my word, I am about to become a single issue voter.
                My support in any upcoming election will be based on your immediate action to address this gap in
                Ukraine’s defense.
                I know, you deal with many requests, but this is an existential need - Ukraine will not survive
                without
                your support. Nothing matters more to me at this moment.
            </div>

            <div class="bst_wishes">
                Sincerely,</br>

        <div><b>But Ukraine has a dire and immediate need that has not yet been addressed - protecting Ukrainian

        <div>
            At the time when Zelenskyy was speaking to Congress, Russian plane dropped a powerful bomb on a theater
            in
            the besieged city of Mariupol sheltering over a thousand civilians.
            It happened because there was not a single Ukrainian fighter jet in the sky over Mariupol which could
            prevent this horrible tragedy.
            This is happening all over Ukraine on a daily basis. Fighter planes is the essential thing that can save
            Ukrainian civilians lives!
